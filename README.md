# Spoiler-Free Baseball

### Motivation

[https://www.mlb.com/](https://www.mlb.com/) has highlight videos available for each of their games, as you can see [here](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/yankees-vs-nationals/2020/07/23/630851#game_state=final,lock_state=final,game_tab=videos,game=630851). The issue is that, to get there, you get the score spoiled for you... Due to the different time zones all over the world not everyone gets the chance of watching the games live, and the condensed games are a good way of having the thrill of following a live game, in a short and always available format. Thus, I've created this very simple tool that allows the user to get the links to those videos and follow the recaps of the games, without having to know the scores of the games beforehand.

### Arguments

#### Position

* `date` - format day/month/year, eg. `05/08/2020`

#### Optional

* `--end_date` - Used if you want to present links for a time range. Expects the same format as `date`.
* `--filter_by_team` - Show only the games for a given team. It expects the full name surrounded by `"`: `"Team"`.
* `--args_check` - If a lot of URLs fail, use this option to test alternatives, and show only working URLs. It's slow if a lot of links have to be checked.
